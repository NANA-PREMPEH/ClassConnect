      <h2>What Exactly Is a Computer?</h2>
      <p>A <strong>computer</strong> is an electronic device that can accept data, process it according to a set of instructions (called a <em>program</em>), and produce results as information. Think of it as a very fast, very obedient machine that follows instructions perfectly.</p>
      <p>Computers are all around us — in our classrooms, homes, banks, hospitals, and even in our pockets as smartphones. They help people work faster, communicate easily, and solve complex problems.</p>

      <div class="info-box">
        <div class="info-box__title">💡 Did You Know?</div>
        <div class="info-box__text">The word "computer" originally referred to a <strong>person</strong> who performed calculations! It was only in the 20th century that the word began to mean the electronic machines we know today.</div>
      </div>

      <h2>Types of Computers</h2>
      <p>Computers come in many sizes and shapes. Here are the most common types you will encounter:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Desktop Computer</strong> — A computer designed to sit on a desk. It has a separate monitor, keyboard, mouse, and system unit. Desktops are powerful and commonly used in offices and computer labs.</li>
        <li><strong>Laptop Computer</strong> — A portable computer that folds open and has everything built in — screen, keyboard, and trackpad. You can carry it in a bag and use it anywhere.</li>
        <li><strong>Tablet</strong> — A flat, touch-screen computer. It is lighter than a laptop and you control it by tapping and swiping the screen. Examples include the iPad and Samsung Galaxy Tab.</li>
        <li><strong>Smartphone</strong> — A small, powerful computer that also makes phone calls. Modern smartphones can browse the internet, take photos, run apps, and much more.</li>
        <li><strong>Server</strong> — A powerful computer that provides services to other computers on a network. When you visit a website, a server somewhere is sending that information to your device.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Generations of Computers</h2>
      <p>Computers have changed dramatically over the years. We group these changes into <strong>generations</strong>:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>First Generation (1940s–1950s)</strong> — Used vacuum tubes. These computers were enormous (filling entire rooms!), very expensive, and generated a lot of heat. Example: ENIAC.</li>
        <li><strong>Second Generation (1950s–1960s)</strong> — Used transistors instead of vacuum tubes. They were smaller, faster, and more reliable.</li>
        <li><strong>Third Generation (1960s–1970s)</strong> — Used integrated circuits (tiny chips with many transistors). Computers became even smaller and more affordable.</li>
        <li><strong>Fourth Generation (1970s–Present)</strong> — Used microprocessors (entire CPUs on a single chip). This is the generation that gave us personal computers, laptops, and smartphones.</li>
        <li><strong>Fifth Generation (Present & Future)</strong> — Focuses on artificial intelligence (AI). These computers can learn, understand speech, and make decisions.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Opening Up the Computer</h2>
      <p>Have you ever wondered what is inside a computer? If you carefully open the case of a desktop computer (called the <strong>system unit</strong>), you will find several important components working together. Let's explore them!</p>

      <h2>The Motherboard</h2>
      <p>The <strong>motherboard</strong> is the largest circuit board inside the computer. Think of it as the "backbone" — it connects all the other parts together and allows them to communicate. Every component, from the CPU to the storage drive, plugs into the motherboard.</p>
      <p>If you look at a motherboard, you will see many slots, sockets, and connectors. Each one has a specific purpose.</p>

      <h2>The CPU — The Brain</h2>
      <p>The <strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</strong> is the most important component. It is often called the "brain" of the computer because it carries out all the instructions from software programs.</p>
      <p>The CPU does two main things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Arithmetic operations</strong> — calculations like adding, subtracting, multiplying</li>
        <li><strong>Logic operations</strong> — comparisons like "Is A greater than B?"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Modern CPUs are incredibly fast. They can perform <em>billions</em> of operations per second! The speed of a CPU is measured in <strong>GHz (gigahertz)</strong>.</p>

      <h2>RAM — The Short-Term Memory</h2>
      <p><strong>RAM (Random Access Memory)</strong> is like a desk where the computer puts things it is currently working on. It is very fast, but it is <em>temporary</em> — when you turn off the computer, everything in RAM disappears.</p>
      <p>The more RAM a computer has, the more tasks it can handle at the same time without slowing down. Most modern computers have between 4 GB and 16 GB of RAM.</p>

      <div class="info-box">
        <div class="info-box__title">🤔 RAM vs. Storage — What's the Difference?</div>
        <div class="info-box__text">
          Think of it this way: <strong>RAM</strong> is like your school desk — it holds what you're working on right now, but you clear it at the end of the day. <strong>Storage</strong> (like a hard drive) is like your school locker — it keeps your books and files safely even when you're not using them.
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>ROM — The Permanent Instructions</h2>
      <p><strong>ROM (Read-Only Memory)</strong> contains permanent instructions that the computer needs to start up. Unlike RAM, ROM keeps its contents even when the power is off. When you press the power button, the computer reads ROM first to know how to begin loading the operating system.</p>

      <h2>The Power Supply Unit (PSU)</h2>
      <p>The <strong>Power Supply Unit</strong> converts the electricity from the wall outlet (AC power) into the type of electricity the computer components need (DC power). Without the PSU, nothing inside the computer would work.</p>

      <h2>How They All Work Together</h2>
      <p>Here's how a simple task works inside the computer:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>You type something on the keyboard (<strong>input</strong>)</li>
        <li>The signal travels through the <strong>motherboard</strong> to the <strong>CPU</strong></li>
        <li>The CPU retrieves instructions and data from <strong>RAM</strong></li>
        <li>The CPU processes the data</li>
        <li>The result is sent to the monitor (<strong>output</strong>)</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>Inside every computer, you'll find a motherboard (the backbone), a CPU (the brain), RAM (short-term memory), ROM (permanent startup instructions), and a power supply. These components work together to process data into useful information.</p>

      <h2>What Are Input Devices?</h2>
      <p>An <strong>input device</strong> is any piece of hardware that lets you send data or commands into a computer. Without input devices, you would have no way to tell the computer what to do!</p>
      <p>When you type a letter, click a button, or speak into a microphone, you are using an input device. The computer receives this input, processes it, and then gives you a result.</p>

      <h2>Common Input Devices</h2>

      <h3>1. Keyboard</h3>
      <p>The <strong>keyboard</strong> is one of the most common input devices. It has keys for letters (A-Z), numbers (0-9), symbols, and special function keys. You use it to type documents, enter passwords, write emails, and give commands to the computer.</p>
      <p>There are different types of keyboards: <strong>wired keyboards</strong> that connect with a cable, and <strong>wireless keyboards</strong> that use Bluetooth or a USB receiver.</p>

      <h3>2. Mouse</h3>
      <p>The <strong>mouse</strong> is a pointing device that controls the cursor (arrow) on the screen. By moving the mouse on a flat surface, you can point to items on the screen. You use buttons on the mouse to select, open, and drag items.</p>
      <p>Types include: <strong>optical mouse</strong> (uses a light sensor), <strong>wireless mouse</strong>, and the <strong>trackpad</strong> (built into laptops).</p>

      <h3>3. Touchscreen</h3>
      <p>A <strong>touchscreen</strong> is both a display and an input device. You interact with it by tapping, swiping, and pinching directly on the screen. Smartphones, tablets, and some modern laptops have touchscreens.</p>

      <h3>4. Microphone</h3>
      <p>A <strong>microphone</strong> captures sound (your voice, music, etc.) and converts it into digital data that the computer can process. It is used for voice calls, recording audio, and voice commands (like talking to a virtual assistant).</p>

      <h3>5. Scanner</h3>
      <p>A <strong>scanner</strong> takes a physical document or photo and converts it into a digital image that you can view, edit, or save on the computer. Scanners are commonly used in offices and schools.</p>

      <h3>6. Webcam (Camera)</h3>
      <p>A <strong>webcam</strong> captures video and images. It is used for video calls, online classes, and taking photos. Most laptops have a built-in webcam above the screen.</p>

      <h2>What Are Output Devices?</h2>
      <p>An <strong>output device</strong> is any piece of hardware that takes processed data from the computer and presents it in a form that humans can understand — such as text on a screen, sound from a speaker, or a printed page.</p>
      <p>If input devices let you <em>talk</em> to the computer, then output devices let the computer <em>talk back</em> to you!</p>

      <h2>Common Output Devices</h2>

      <h3>1. Monitor (Screen)</h3>
      <p>The <strong>monitor</strong> is the most common output device. It displays everything you see — your documents, websites, videos, and the desktop. Monitors come in different sizes and types:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>LCD (Liquid Crystal Display)</strong> — thin, lightweight, and energy-efficient</li>
        <li><strong>LED (Light Emitting Diode)</strong> — a type of LCD that uses LED backlighting for brighter, sharper images</li>
        <li><strong>Touchscreen monitors</strong> — serve as both input and output devices</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Printer</h3>
      <p>A <strong>printer</strong> produces a <em>hard copy</em> (physical paper version) of digital documents. There are several types:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Inkjet Printer</strong> — sprays tiny drops of ink onto paper. Good for photos and color documents.</li>
        <li><strong>Laser Printer</strong> — uses a laser beam and toner powder. Fast and efficient for large amounts of text.</li>
        <li><strong>3D Printer</strong> — creates three-dimensional physical objects from digital designs!</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Speakers and Headphones</h3>
      <p><strong>Speakers</strong> convert electrical signals into sound. They output music, voice, sound effects, and system alerts. <strong>Headphones</strong> work the same way but deliver sound directly to your ears privately.</p>

      <h3>4. Projector</h3>
      <p>A <strong>projector</strong> takes the computer's display and projects it as a large image on a wall or screen. Projectors are widely used in classrooms and meetings to show presentations and videos to a large audience.</p>

      <h3>5. Plotter</h3>
      <p>A <strong>plotter</strong> is a special type of printer that draws high-quality graphics, maps, architectural plans, and engineering designs on large paper. Unlike regular printers, plotters use pens to draw continuous lines.</p>

    ],
    content: `
      <h2>Why Do We Need Storage?</h2>
      <p>Remember that <strong>RAM</strong> only holds data temporarily — it disappears when the computer shuts down. So where do we keep our files, photos, documents, and programs permanently? That's the job of <strong>storage devices</strong>.</p>
      <p>Storage devices save data so you can access it later — even days, months, or years from now.</p>

      <h2>Types of Storage</h2>

      <h3>1. Hard Disk Drive (HDD)</h3>
      <p>An <strong>HDD</strong> is one of the oldest types of storage still in use today. Inside, it has spinning magnetic disks (called <em>platters</em>) and a read/write head that moves across them to store and retrieve data.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Large storage capacity (500 GB to several TB), relatively cheap</li>
        <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Slower than SSDs, has moving parts that can break if dropped</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Solid State Drive (SSD)</h3>
      <p>An <strong>SSD</strong> stores data on flash memory chips — there are no moving parts. This makes it much faster, more durable, and quieter than an HDD.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Very fast read/write speeds, durable (no moving parts), silent</li>
        <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> More expensive per gigabyte than HDDs</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Flash Drive (USB Pen Drive)</h3>
      <p>A <strong>flash drive</strong> (sometimes called a pen drive or thumb drive) is a small, portable storage device that plugs into a USB port. It uses the same flash memory technology as SSDs but in a tiny, carry-anywhere form.</p>
      <p>Flash drives typically range from 4 GB to 256 GB and are very convenient for moving files between computers.</p>

      <h3>4. Memory Card (SD Card)</h3>
      <p>An <strong>SD card</strong> is a tiny storage card used in cameras, smartphones, and tablets. Despite its small size, it can hold a large amount of data — from photos to videos to apps.</p>

      <h3>5. Optical Discs (CD, DVD, Blu-ray)</h3>
      <p><strong>Optical discs</strong> store data that is read by a laser beam. CDs hold about 700 MB, DVDs about 4.7 GB, and Blu-ray discs up to 50 GB. They are less common today but are still used for movies, music, and software distribution.</p>

      <h3>6. Cloud Storage</h3>
      <p><strong>Cloud storage</strong> saves your files on remote servers accessed through the internet. Services like <strong>Google Drive</strong>, <strong>Dropbox</strong>, and <strong>OneDrive</strong> allow you to store, access, and share files from any device with an internet connection.</p>

      <div class="info-box">

      </div>

      <h2>Putting It All Together: The Computer System</h2>
      <p>Now you know all the main parts of a computer system. Let's see how they work together in a real example:</p>
      <p><em>Imagine you want to type a school report and print it:</em></p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Input:</strong> You type your report using the <strong>keyboard</strong> (input device)</li>
        <li><strong>Processing:</strong> The <strong>CPU</strong> processes each keystroke, using <strong>RAM</strong> to temporarily hold your document</li>
        <li><strong>Output:</strong> The <strong>monitor</strong> (output device) displays your text as you type</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> You save the file to the <strong>hard drive</strong> (storage device) so you won't lose it</li>
        <li><strong>Output:</strong> You send the document to the <strong>printer</strong> (output device) to get a paper copy</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This is the complete cycle: <strong>Input → Processing → Output → Storage</strong>. Every task on a computer follows this pattern!</p>

      <div class="info-box">
        <div class="info-box__title">🇬🇭 Local Connection</div>
        <div class="info-box__text">In many Ghanaian schools, students use flash drives to save their work and carry it between home and the computer lab. Understanding storage helps you keep your schoolwork safe and organized. Always remember to safely eject your flash drive before removing it!</div>
      </div>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>Storage devices keep our data safe permanently. HDDs offer large, affordable storage; SSDs are faster but costlier; flash drives are portable and convenient; and cloud storage lets us access files anywhere with internet. Together, input devices, the CPU, RAM, output devices, and storage devices form a complete computer system that follows the cycle: Input → Processing → Output → Storage.</p>
